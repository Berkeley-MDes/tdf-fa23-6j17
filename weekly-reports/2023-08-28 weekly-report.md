### Reflections:

I made a mistake in my choice of materials

1. the size of clear acrylic i purchase is two big, which lead to there is only one machine that I can use in Jacob hall.

2. the acrylic is too thin

Therefore, next time, I will carefully investigate the materials and measure every detail of the product more carefully
