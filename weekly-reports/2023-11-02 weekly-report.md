I #  Week of /02/2023 (Week 11)
## Zoe(Jiayi) Liu, Technology Design Foundations

### Summary: 
This week, I completed my report on the personal AI project, and began brainstorming ideas for the final project. Currently, I'm contemplating developing a virtual art gallery experience. This interactive space would allow visitors to engage with art installations in real-time, utilizing Personal AI. The experience would be further enriched with dynamic lighting and visual effects, utilizing Photon 2 technology.
