### Reflections:

I made a mistake in my choice of materials

1. the size of the clear acrylic I purchased is too big, which leads to only one machine I can use in Jacob Hall.

2. the acrylic is too thin

Therefore, next time, I will carefully investigate the materials and measure every detail of the product more carefully.
