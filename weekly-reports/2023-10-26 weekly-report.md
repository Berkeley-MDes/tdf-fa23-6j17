#  Week of /02/2023 (Week 10)
## Zoe(Jiayi) Liu, Technology Design Foundations

### Summary: 
This week, I work with Zerowidth, and the main challenge this week is the effective integration of personal data with AI. This requires ensuring that the system can process and understand structured input to produce relevant and meaningful responses. This requires careful calibration of the AI to grasp the subtleties of my personal narrative and preferences, transforming it into an insightful entity that can interact with me in a way that is both insightful and intuitive. To get this right requires a commitment to adaptation and testing.
